\# Titanic Survival Prediction (EDA + ML)



Exploratory Data Analysis and Logistic Regression model to predict Titanic passenger survival.



\## Steps

\- Performed EDA with Seaborn (gender, age, fare, class correlations)

\- Cleaned missing data and encoded categorical features

\- Trained Logistic Regression achieving ~80% accuracy



\## Tech Stack

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook



\## Output

\- Graphs showing key survival factors

\- Final model accuracy printed in notebook

\- Saved `titanic\_cleaned.csv` and `model\_accuracy.txt`
